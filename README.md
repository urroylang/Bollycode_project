# Bollycode_project

This creative coding project is a musical composition remake of one of the most iconic Bollywood tunes - title song of DDLJ, Tujhe Dekha To using Tunepad. It was basically inspired by my South Asian heritage and influence that Bollywood music has had on my upbringing. My goal was to combine my cultural identity with coding and showcase how a simple melody can be translated using the boundaries of digital composition.

## General info
This project explores the music and code of DDLJ's title song using Tunepad with Python's programming features. Tunepad is a empowering platform that allows users to code music and express themselves creatively by providing programmable instruments, looping and editing (Horn et al. 2022). Bollywood music is often rarely represented in algorithmic music and traditionally focuses more on Western music. This project emphasises on blending cultural heritage and code literacy in music by integrating a meaningful tune into Tunepad.

## Technologies Used
- Tunepad (Python programming)
- GitHub
- Miro
- iMovie
- Voice Memo

## Features
Melody - main tune of DDLJ
Harmony - background music of drums and beatboxing
Documentation - personal journal entries, concept maps, screenshots, references

## Screenshots
Refer to GitHub and A2 for all screenshots

## Usage
- Press play to listen to the whole coding music together
- To listen to the main melody run the acoustic guitar on its own
- To listen to the background music run all the drums together

## Project Status
Project is complete and due on 4/11/25

## Room for Improvement
- Broaden my musical scope and make it more intricate and complex
- Refining the layers of certain notes
- More research on how to combine multiple tunes together that work well
