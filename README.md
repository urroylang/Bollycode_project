# Bollycode_project

This creative coding project is a musical composition remake of one of the most iconic Bollywood tunes - title song of DDLJ, Tujhe Dekha To using Tunepad. It was basically inspired by my South Asian heritage and influence that Bollywood music has had on my upbringing. My goal was to combine my cultural identity with coding and showcase how a simple melody can be translated using the boundaries of digital composition.
